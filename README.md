# docker-net-dhcp-lab

Runs [docker-net-dhcp](https://github.com/claymore666/docker-net-dhcp) against
real DHCP servers and routers, each installed the way its users install it,
and publishes what passed.

Work in progress. The repository becomes public once the first results page
exists.

## Bring up the reference cell

```
scripts/bootstrap-host.sh          # once per lab host
scripts/demo-ref-cell.sh ref-only  # one command, issue #1
scripts/down-cell.sh ref-only <work-dir>  # tear it back down
```

`lab.yaml` declares the cells; `verify.sh` is the arbiter (CI runs it on
every push and PR). See `docs/` in the plugin repo's track file for the
full design.

Every VM boots UEFI (OVMF); its per-VM NVRAM copy lives under the cell's
work directory and `down-cell.sh` removes it. `up-cell.sh` refuses to
attach a VM to `net-mgmt` unless the host's `ci_dmz` firewall chain is in
place (`scripts/containment-preflight.sh`).
