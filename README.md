# docker-net-dhcp-lab

Runs [docker-net-dhcp](https://github.com/claymore666/docker-net-dhcp) against
real DHCP servers and routers, each installed the way its users install it,
and publishes what passed.

Work in progress. The repository becomes public once the first results page
exists.

## Bring up the reference cell

```
scripts/bootstrap-host.sh          # once per lab host
scripts/demo-ref-cell.sh ref-only  # one command, issue #1
scripts/down-cell.sh ref-only <work-dir>  # tear it back down
```

`lab.yaml` declares the cells; `verify.sh` is the arbiter (CI runs it on
every push and PR).

Every VM boots UEFI (OVMF); its per-VM NVRAM copy lives under the cell's
work directory and `down-cell.sh` removes it. `up-cell.sh` refuses to
attach a VM to `net-mgmt` unless the host's `ci_dmz` firewall chain is
present at priority -10 with a rule that drops by destination
(`scripts/containment-preflight.sh`, run via `sudo -n` since reading
nftables state needs root). That check only reads the ruleset text; it
cannot prove traffic is actually blocked end to end. The proof of that
is `dmz-probe.sh ""` run inside the Docker host VM at a live run, not
this preflight.

## Bring up a source cell

Kea, ISC dhcpd and dnsmasq each get their own cell, apt-installed with a
stock config plus a pool (issue #2). A Go adapter reads each source's
own lease table (control API, `dhcpd.leases`, or the dnsmasq lease
file) rather than trusting the plugin's own report.

```
scripts/demo-source-cell.sh kea        # or isc-dhcp, or dnsmasq
scripts/down-cell.sh kea <work-dir>
```

`labctl leases <source-type> <mgmt-ip> <known-hosts>` prints one
source's table on its own, through the same adapter.
